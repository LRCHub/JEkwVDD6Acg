Y-yo, y-yo
Y-yo, y-yo
Y-y-yo, yo
Y-y-yo

Y-yo
Uh-huh, y-yo
Uh-uh
Y-y-yo

It could all be simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me who I have to be
To get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend, that you can't stay
Tell me who I have to be
To get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working, it ain't working
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy

I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself?
As crazy as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else
I know what we've got to do
You let go I'll let go too
No one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will

Yo, y-yo, yo yo
I'm here now, not just because it's my year now
I'm clear now, only feeling cats that's sincere now
Heart of lioness, scientist, street Zionist
Don't twist it, it's consistently consistent
If you missed it, this train is bound for glory
End of story, my whole repository is Psalm: 40
They bomb for me

Thinking they can mess with your plan
But I'm a play lamb
Knowing that the Kingdom's at hand
And showing those who want it
You gon' bring them the land
Descendants of Ham

Not concerned with the platinum status
Cause every joint I threw, I would do for gratis
I'm on the train with my Pips like I'm lil Gladys
Or in the Range throwing chips to the kids in Addis
Ababa, two kids and and a baby father
Hot to lava, we Don Dada
Don Dada

No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working, it ain't working
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy

Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me

Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

Oh no, why won't you live for me?
Why won't you live for me?
For me, for me

Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me

Give to me

It could all be simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you, loving you, is like a battle
(Hmm)
Give to me, care for me
Give to me, care for me
Care for me
