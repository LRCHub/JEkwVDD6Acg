Two ferries collide and you'll be the one
Standing on the dock reading papers in the sun
The ice age arrives you'll keep me warm
Falling at your feet with no feelings of my own

What do i do with you lately
What can i do with you lately

Two robbers arrive big guys with guns
You'll be the one looking backwards as we run
Crusaders come by fat guys who sing
You'll be the one not believing anything

What do i do for you lately
What can i do for you

I'm not afraid of you you're very nice in fact
Now give me all your cigarettes
These little love attacks
Are making me feel queasy
Can't get my heart rate down

Two missionaries come with conversion kits
You'll be the one sewing cotton through their lips
We wear out the sun you'll be the one
Lying on the roof wearing factor 41

I'm not afraid of you you're very nice
In fact you've got it all, you're very tall
I'm totally impressed, can't get my heart rate down

I'm not afraid of you you're very nice
In fact you've got it all but i'm bored
Of being sycophantic
So get your knickers down
